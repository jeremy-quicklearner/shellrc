# shellrc
My dotfiles for various shells. To apply them, type:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jeremy-quicklearner/shellrc.git
$ ./vim/setup
```

If you already have a ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc., all the config
is **appended** to it.

If you do a `git pull` on this repo and there are changes, they should
be applied no problem.

Additions specific to your setup can be added to the `~/.shellrc` file.
